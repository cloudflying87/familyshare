## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Using commas in numbers**: `14,500` ‚Üí Use `14500`
‚ùå **Reusing URLs**: Each car needs unique URL
‚ùå **Wrong recommendation values**: Use `excellent`, `good`, `acceptable`, `avoid` (lowercase)
‚ùå **Missing headers**: Always keep first row with column names
‚ùå **Saving as Excel (.xlsx)**: Must save as CSV (.csv)

‚úÖ **Correct format**:
```csv
make,model,trim,year,url,dealer,price,mileage,winter_rating,reliability_rating,recommendation,mpg_highway,mpg_city,ground_clearance,notes
Subaru,Forester,,2015,https://dealer.com/car1,Bob's Auto,14500,85000,10,7,acceptable,28,22,8.7,Good deal
